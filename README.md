# Github Directory Component with React

Hello, today I am with you with a test case. I present to you the component where we can control the directories of our repos in Github. It was a lot of fun to make. If you want to test yourself, you can use this case.

Requirements:

* When the input field is empty, pressing the delete key should move to the previous directory (it is important not to break the contents of the directory while doing this)

* Pressing "/" or "Enter" should create a new directory without checking if the input is empty or not.
